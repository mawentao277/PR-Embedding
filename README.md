## News
**2020/7/16 we have released the codes**, and the data for the personachat example is in [data_for_personachat](http://pan.iflytek.com:80/link/10FAC9799FA892B66D481080BAF99BA8) (password vzoQ). You can clone the codes and download the data to have a try ^^  
**2020/7/6 We have already uploaded the Chinese PR-Embedding** based on Zhidao (password g3FK) and Weibo (password Yz6H) [Zhidao Embedding](http://pan.iflytek.com:80/link/AA19A09424DD80437F1A5E6C73F03A84) |
[Weibo Embedding](http://pan.iflytek.com:80/link/465C101719F25F89A472D4E6F7E51275). Where the Zhidao Embedding has been used in the experiment part of the paper.
